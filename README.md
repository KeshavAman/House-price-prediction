# House-price-prediction
House price prediction using machine learning algorithms
In this model, we will predict the pricing of Houses by the help of machine learning algorithms. The dataset weâ€™ll be using is the Boston Housing Dataset. The dataset comprises 13 input features and one target feature. The input features include features that may or may not impact the price.
